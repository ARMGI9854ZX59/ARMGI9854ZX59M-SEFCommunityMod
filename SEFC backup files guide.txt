Main versions should be completely reinstalled and some data will be lost. 
To avoid this you can backup some files and replace them in the new "SEFCommunityMod" folder.

Campaign progress:
SEFCommunityMod/System -> Campaign.ini

Your last loadouts:
SEFCommunityMod/System -> DynamicLoadout.ini

Your personal settings, for example, keyboard settings:
SEFCommunityMod/System -> User.ini

Your mission results:
SEFCommunityMod/System -> MissionResults.ini
