Since I recommend to reinstall new main versions completely some data will be lost. 
To avoid this you can backup some files and replace them in the new "SEFCommunityModv7" folder.

Campaign progress:
SEFCommunityModv7/System -> Campaign.ini

Your last loadouts:
SEFCommunityModv7/System -> DynamicLoadout.ini
